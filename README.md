Part 2: Creating Composite Shapes
Pumpkin!
Here you will use the shapes functions created in Part 1 to create composite images.
In the function below, you build a pumpkin using circles and stem using turtle functions.
def draw_pumpkin(t, x, y, radius):
"""Draws a pumpkin (orange circle) at the given (x, y) location with a green stem."""
t.penup()
t.goto(x, y)
t.pendown()
t.fillcolor("orange")
t.begin_fill()
t.circle(radius)
t.end_fill()

    # Drawing the stem
    t.fillcolor("green")
    t.begin_fill()
    t.left(90)  # Point upwards
    t.forward(radius // 2)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(radius // 5)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(radius // 2)
    t.left(90)
    t.forward(radius // 5)
    t.end_fill()
Now we'll use the polygon function to add the jack-o-lantern eyes and mouth!
Adding the Face
def draw_eye(t, x, y, size):
"""Draws one triangular eye at the given (x, y) position."""
t.penup()
t.goto(x, y)
t.pendown()
t.fillcolor("yellow")
t.begin_fill()
draw_polygon(t, 3, size)
t.end_fill()

def draw_mouth(t, x, y, width):
"""Draws a jagged mouth using a series of connected lines."""
t.penup()
t.goto(x, y)
t.pendown()
t.fillcolor("yellow")
t.begin_fill()
for _ in range(5):  # Create a simple zigzag mouth
t.forward(width // 5)
t.left(120)
t.forward(width // 5)
t.right(120)
t.end_fill()
Let's test your new jack-o-lantern code.
# Example of drawing a jack-o-lantern with eyes and a mouth
draw_pumpkin(t, 0, -100, 100)  # Draw the pumpkin
draw_eye(t, -40, 0, 30)  # Left eye
draw_eye(t, 40, 0, 30)   # Right eye
draw_mouth(t, -50, -50, 100)  # Mouth
This pumpkin doesn't quite look right! When you test the draw_pumpkin function, it draws the stem at the bottom of the pumpkin.
Fix the function to draw the stem in the correct location.
This pumpkin still doesn't quote look right. When you draw the face, the mouth is mis-positioned and points in the wrong direction.
Fix the function to draw the mouth in the correct direction and location.
Part 3: Let the Stars Shine for You
Drawing a Star
First let's draw a single star!
def draw_star(t, x, y, size):
"""Draws a star at the given (x, y) position."""
t.penup()
t.goto(x, y)
t.pendown()
t.fillcolor("white")
t.begin_fill()
for _ in range(5):
t.forward(size)
t.right(144)  # 144 degrees is the angle to form a star
t.end_fill()

# Example usage
draw_star(t, -100, 150, 30)  # Star in the sky
draw_star(t, 100, 180, 20)
Next, add a function to fill the night sky with random stars!
Consider moving the import random to the top of your code (it's not a rule, but is a convention).
import random

def draw_sky(t, num_stars):
"""Draws a starry sky with the given number of stars."""
for _ in range(num_stars):
x = random.randint(-300, 300)
y = random.randint(0, 300)
size = random.randint(10, 30)
draw_star(t, x, y, size)

# Example usage
draw_sky(t, 20)  # Draw 20 stars
Part 4: Putting all the Incremental Development Together!
In this final part, you will use the functions you've written to create a composite scene with multiple jack-o-lanterns under a starry sky.
# Draw three jack-o-lanterns
draw_pumpkin(t, -150, -150, 100)
draw_eye(t, -190, -60, 30)  # Left eye
draw_eye(t, -110, -60, 30)  # Right eye
draw_mouth(t, -190, -100, 80)  # Mouth

draw_pumpkin(t, 0, -150, 80)
draw_eye(t, -20, -70, 25)
draw_eye(t, 20, -70, 25)
draw_mouth(t, -30, -110, 60)

draw_pumpkin(t, 150, -150, 100)
draw_eye(t, 110, -60, 30)
draw_eye(t, 190, -60, 30)
draw_mouth(t, 110, -100, 80)

# Draw the night sky
draw_sky(t, 30)
OH NO! There is a problem with this code!
The jack-o-lanterns are TOO HIGH in their window! Lower the jack-o-lanterns so that they remain proportionately the same, but are resting near the bottom.
OH NO! There is something else wrong!
Some of the random stars can touch the pumpkin stems or the pumpkins themselves. Fix the code so that the stars can not reach the pumpkin stems.
Part 5: Reflection
In a new README.md, reflect on how encapsulation and generalization helped us break down the drawing process for this scene.
